        "I have a long-term research project regarding a specific set of proteins. I am attempting to discover small organic compounds that can bind strongly to these proteins and thus act as drugs. I have already made laboratory experiments to measure the affinities between some proteins and drug molecules.\n",
        "\n",
        "My colleague is working on another set of proteins, and the objectives of his project are similar to mine. He has recently discovered thousands of new potential drug molecules. He asked me if I could find the pairs that have the strongest affinities among his proteins and drug molecules. Obviously I do not have the resources to measure all the possible pairs in my laboratory, so I need to prioritise. I decided to do this with the help of machine learning, but I have encountered a problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is what I have done so far: First I trained a K-nearest neighbours regressor with the parameter value K=10 using all the 400 measurements I had already made in the laboratory with my proteins and drug molecules. They comprise of 77 target proteins and 59 drug molecules. Then I performed a leave-one-out cross-validation with this same data to estimate the generalisation performance of the model. I used C-index and got a stellar score above 90%. Finally I used the model to predict the affinities of my colleague's proteins and drug molecules. The problem is: when I selected the highest predicted affinities and tried to verify them in the lab, I found that many of them are much lower in reality. My model clearly does not work despite the high cross-validation score.\n",
        "\n",
        "Please explain why my estimation failed and how leave-one-out cross-validation should be performed to get a reliable estimate. Also, implement the correct leave-one-out cross-validation and report its results. I need to know whether it would be a waste of my resources if I were to use my model any further.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data I used to create my model is available in the files `input.data`, `output.data` and `pairs.data` for you to use. The first file contains the features of the pairs, whereas the second contains their affinities. The third file contains the identifiers of the drug and target molecules of which the pairs are composed. The files are paired, i.e. the i<sup>*th*</sup> row in each file is about the same pair.\n",
